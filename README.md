## 🎯 Challenge Overview

The WRO 2025 Future Engineers challenge tasks teams with developing a fully autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a dynamic, randomized racetrack using sensors, computer vision, and advanced control algorithms.

**Key objectives:**
- Complete multiple laps while adapting to randomized obstacles and following driving rules.
- Successfully execute a parallel parking maneuver at the end.

---

### 📌 Competition Format

**🏁 Open Challenge:**  
Complete 3 laps on a track with randomly placed inside walls.

**🚦 Obstacle Challenge:**  
Detect and respond to red and green traffic signs while completing 3 laps:  
- 🟥 Red marker: Stay on the right side.
- 🟩 Green marker: Stay on the left side.

**🅿️ Parking:**  
Locate and perform a precise parallel parking maneuver after laps.
